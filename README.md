## Objective

- Analyze survival rates across different features such as gender, age, class, and family size.
- Visualize the data to understand relationships and missing values.
- Identify which features influenced survival chances the most.

## Key Insights

- Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Children under 10 had better survival chances.
